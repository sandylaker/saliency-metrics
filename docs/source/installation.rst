Installation
============

Here are the steps for installing ``saliency-metrics``.

#. Clone the `Repo <https://github.com/sandylaker/saliency-metrics.git>`_ using git.

#. Install the package in the editable mode: ``pip install -e .`` (do not miss the ``.`` in the end).

``saliency-metrics`` adopts similar configuration and registry systems as
`mmdetection <https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_,
which relies on `mmcv <https://mmcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
We highly encourage users to read the tutorials about mmcv's
`Config <https://mmcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/understand_mmcv/config.html>`_ and
`Registry <https://mmcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/understand_mmcv/registry.html>`_ when getting started.
